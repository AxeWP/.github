# Support

If you have a question, a bug report, a feature request, or any other feedback, please use the issue tracker of the project you are interested in. You can find a list of our projects and their repositories on our [website](https://axepress.dev/projects).

Before creating a new issue, please search for existing issues to avoid duplicates. Also, please follow the issue template and provide as much information as possible to help us understand and resolve your issue.

We try to respond to issues as quickly as we can, but please understand that we are a small team and we may not be able to reply immediately. We appreciate your patience and cooperation.

Priority and personalized support is available to our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/AxeWP), or via a [custom support plan](https://axepress.dev/services). For more information, you can contact us by email at [support@axepress.dev](mailto:support@axepress.dev).

Thank you for using our projects and supporting our work. We hope you enjoy them and find them useful. ðŸ˜Š
