## GitHub Workflow
We use GitHub to host our code, manage our issues and pull requests, and collaborate on our projects. If you are new to GitHub, you can learn the basics from the GitHub Guides.

Here are the steps to follow when you want to make a code contribution:

1. Fork the repository of the plugin or theme you want to work on.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, following the naming convention `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.
4. Make your changes in your branch, following the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). The specific standards for each project are stored in the `.phpcs.xml.dist` file in the root of the project.
5. Commit and push your changes to your fork.
6. Create a pull request from your branch to the original repository, following the pull request template.
7. Wait for feedback or approval from the maintainers.


## Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug or an issue with any of our plugins or themes, please let us know by opening an issue on GitHub. Please use the issue template and provide as much information as possible to help us reproduce and fix the problem.

Some examples of information to include are:

- The plugin name and version
- The WordPress version, WPGraphQL version and environment
- The headless framework or tool used
- The steps to reproduce the issue

## Requesting Features
If you have an idea or a suggestion for a new feature or an improvement for any of our plugins or themes, please share it with us by opening an issue on GitHub. Please use the issue template and explain the rationale and benefits of your proposal.

Some examples of information to include are:

- The plugin or theme name and version
- The problem or need that your feature solves
- The use cases or scenarios that your feature enables
- Any examples or references of similar features in other projects

# Writing Documentation
We believe that good documentation is essential for any project, especially for headless WordPress development. We welcome contributions that improve or expand our documentation, such as:

- Fixing typos or errors
- Adding examples or screenshots
- Updating outdated information
- Clarifying instructions or concepts

You can contribute to our documentation by editing the Markdown files in the /docs/ directory of each plugin or theme repository, or by creating new Markdown files if needed. Please follow the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for formatting and style tips.

When writing documentation, please keep in mind the following principles:

- Be clear and concise: Use simple and direct language, avoid jargon and technical terms, and explain any acronyms or abbreviations.
- Be accurate and consistent: Use correct spelling and grammar, follow the same terminology and tone throughout the document, and check your facts and sources.
- Be helpful and informative: Provide relevant and useful information, answer common questions and address potential issues, and link to external resources and references.
- Be respectful and inclusive: Use gender-neutral and non-discriminatory language, avoid stereotypes and bias, and acknowledge different perspectives and experiences.

## Reviewing Code
We appreciate contributions that help us ensure the quality and consistency of our codebase, such as:

- Checking for bugs or errors
- Suggesting optimizations or enhancements
- Applying coding standards or best practices
- Refactoring or simplifying code
- Adding comments or documentation

You can contribute to our code review process by commenting on pull requests or by creating your own pull requests with suggested changes.

When reviewing code, please keep in mind the following principles:

- Be constructive and polite: Give honest and respectful feedback, focus on the code and not the person, and avoid harsh or rude comments.
- Be specific and actionable: Explain what is wrong and why, provide concrete examples or suggestions, and link to relevant resources or guidelines.
- Be supportive and appreciative: Recognize the effort and intention of the contributor, acknowledge their strengths and achievements, and thank them for their work.
