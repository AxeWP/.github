[AxePress Development](https://axepress.dev) is a web development agency dedicated to providing open-source solutions for Headless WordPress sites, and growing the [WPGraphQL](https://wpgraphql.com) ecosystem.

We care deeply about the WPGraphQL ecosystem. Every dollar sponsored doesn't just go towards support and continued development of our plugins, but allows us to work on new open-source solutions and contribute back to WPGraphQL core and the Headless WordPress community.

## Getting Support 
We provide free basic support for all our plugins in their respective GitHub repositories, as well as in the [WPGraphQL Community on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wp-graphql/shared_invite/zt-3vloo60z-PpJV2PFIwEathWDOxCTTLA). Additional tiers of support are available to our [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/AxeWP).

We also offer paid support for other WPGraphQL extensions, as well as custom development services.
